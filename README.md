# UGIPS
# 🌐 UGIPS – Universal Generative Instruction Prompt Specification

**UGIPS** is a vendor-neutral, open specification for structuring prompts in a consistent and interoperable way across generative AI platforms like OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, and others.

> 🔗 Think of UGIPS as the **"HTML for AI prompts"** — a universal format to define instructions, roles, context, examples, and output structure, no matter which LLM you use.

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ **Model-Agnostic**: Compatible with all major LLM providers  
- ✅ **Modular & Structured**: Clearly defined sections for robust prompting  
- ✅ **Human + Machine Readable**: Markdown + JSON-compatible  
- ✅ **Portable & Versioned**: Works across tools, pipelines, and enterprises  
- ✅ **Open Standard**: Built to evolve with contributions from the community
